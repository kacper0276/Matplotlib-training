# Matplotlib_Training

Matplotlib_Training is a repository designed for practicing data visualization using Python's Matplotlib and Pandas libraries. This project focuses on creating various types of charts and plots to gain hands-on experience with data visualization techniques.

## Description

This repository contains Python scripts and notebooks for practicing data visualization. The main objectives are:

- **Creating Charts**: Learn how to create different types of charts including line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and more using Matplotlib.
- **Data Handling**: Use Pandas for data manipulation and preparation before visualization.
- **Customization**: Explore customization options for charts, such as colors, labels, titles, and legends.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Apply various visualization techniques to represent data effectively.

## Technologies

- **Python**: A programming language used for creating and executing the visualization scripts.
- **Matplotlib**: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library that provides data structures and functions needed to work with structured data.

## Installation

To set up the project locally and run the visualization scripts:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kacper0276/Matplotlib-training.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Matplotlib-training
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib pandas
    ```
